Solar Power Panel Data Logger (in Java)


In 2014 I installed my own solar panels and now I want to have my own control over the data which is generated by the inverter.

My inverter is a OmnikSol 2.0k and I have a Wifi kit installed to remotely retrieve the data.

Not much information is available on the dataoutput of this inverter. But looking at a few other projects (see also https://github.com/Woutrrr/Omnik-Data-Logger) I did manage to define a few datastructures. The txt files in this project contain information on the dataformats used, for those interested!

Currently there is one project which contains a datalogger which still polls a javascript file from the inverters internal webpage. However, I started coding a small server listening to the pushed data from the inverter.

I recently saw information regarding another way to pull data. This is using a separate service which the inverter apparantly has. I have not yet been able to check this out yet.

## OmnikSol Message Format

Due to lightning, I had to replace my inverter and suddenly the software did not work properly anymore. After analysing the cause, I found out that the message format was different between the two inverters which had different firmware versions. Below are tables describing the message formats and what I have found out so far.

The two versions I have found, have a difference in the header which I think is the message version specifyer. The distinction for me are the 7D and 81 values.

The 7D version message size is 170 and the 81 version message size is 174.

### Common for both message versions

The hex column and dec column show the position in the message in bytes. The length gives the length of the fields in bytes and the description is, eugh well, the description!

| HEX | DEC | LENGTH | DESCRIPTION
| --- | --- | ------ | -------------------------------------------
| 00  | 000 | [1]    | Fixed value [68] (same as request message)	
| 01  | 001 | [1]    | Message version 7D or 81 hex

### Specific for a certain version

The table below shows the differences between message versions. The description is leading.

The two versions currently known are 7D and 81. 

| 7D      | 7D      | 81      |81       |   -        | -
| ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------

| 61      | 097     | 65      | 101     | [15]       | firmware version (main)
| 70      | 112     | 74      | 116     | [5]        | ??? 00 values
