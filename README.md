Solar Power Panel Data Logger (in Java)


I recently installed my own solar panels and now I want to have my own control over the data which is generated by the inverter.

My inverter is a OmnikSol 2.0k and I have a Wifi kit installed to remotely retrieve the data.

Not much information is available on the dataoutput of this inverter. But looking at a few other projects (see also https://github.com/Woutrrr/Omnik-Data-Logger) I did manage to define a few datastructures. The txt files in this project contain information on the dataformats used, for those interested!

Currently there is one project which contains a datalogger which still polls a javascript file from the inverters internal webpage. However, I started coding a small server listening to the pushed data from the inverter.

I recently saw information regarding another way to pull data. This is using a separate service which the inverter apparantly has. I have not yet been able to check this out yet.
